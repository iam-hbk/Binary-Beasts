The main issues we deal with are domestic violence, financial rights such as grants and pensions, 
child abuse and workersâ€™ rights. Staff provide legal advice, mediations, counselling, referrals and 
educational workshops, and negotiate with service providers on behalf of clients so that they get the 
best possible outcome.
