      The willingness to heal is the first step toward healing. On the road to recovery, 
      your desire to feel better can be your most powerful ally. Do not give in to the ego's
      attempts to convince you that there is something wrong with you: there is nothing wrong with you.
       The reactions you have as a result of trauma are only reactions; they do not define who you are. 
      GET HELP from Crime-Line provides a variety of support groups and legal representation 
      that can be your first step toward healing.
