        The first step to healing is having the will to heal. The desire to feel better can be 
        your best ally on the road to recovery. Do not give in to the ego, which will try to tell 
        you there is something wrong with you: there is nothing wrong with you. The reactions you 
        experience because of trauma are only responses— they are not who you are. Crime-Line’s GET HELP 
        offers a variety of support groups and legal representation that can be your first step to healing.
